## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For a ready to use Docker environment with all prerequisites already installed
and prepared, you can check out the [Docker environment](#docker-environment)
section.

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noi-techpark/odh-vkg.git
```

Change directory:

```bash
cd odh-vkg/
```

### Local deployment

1. Create the `.env` file in which, amongst all, the SPARQL endpoint port and
   the PG external port (for debugging purposes) are specified
   * `cp .env.example .env`
2. Start the Docker container (see [the dedicated section](#Start-and-stop-the-containers))
3. Visit the SPARQL endpoint
   * Now we can open the link <http://localhost:8080> in the browser and test
     some SPARQL queries
   * Note that synchronisation between the master and the slave takes some time.
     Until it is finished, some queries may return empty results.

#### Docker environment
For the project a Docker environment is already prepared and ready to use with
all necessary prerequisites.

The default Docker Compose file *(docker-compose.yml)* uses 3 containers:
 - A PostgreSQL  DB containing a fragment of the ODH Tourism dataset
 - Ontop as SPARQL endpoint
 - Nginx as reverse proxy and cache


#### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker Compose) locally on your machine.

#### Start and stop the containers

##### Option 1: On the foreground

To start the container on the foreground:
```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up --build
```
The container is run on the foreground and can be stopped by pressing CTRL-C.

##### Option 2: On the background

To start the container on the background:
```
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up --build -d
```

To stop it:
```
docker-compose down
```

#### Authentication
A second Docker-compose file (`docker-compose.auth.yml`) can be used for testing
access control policies. It requires a running and configurable instance of
Keycloak. See https://github.com/noi-techpark/authentication-server for
instructions on how to install it locally. Refer to [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md) for instruction on how to configure Keycloak and the authentication proxy.

## Deployment at NOI

All NOI specific infrastructure documentation and scripts can be found inside
the `infrastructure` folder. See
[infrastructure/README.md](infrastructure/README.md) for details.

#### Database synchronization
The SPARQL endpoints do not query directly the production database but slave
read-only instances, which are synchronized with the master database through
logical replication. For more details, see [the dedicated
page](https://github.com/noi-techpark/documentation/blob/master/logical-replication.md).


## Maintenance

### Schema evolution

[See the dedicated page](docs/schema-evolution.md)

### Test database images
For building a newer version of the Docker image of the test database out of a
fresh dump, please refer to [Tourism master](docs/test-tourism-master.md). This
Docker image is published [on Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ontopicvkg/odh-tourism-db).
